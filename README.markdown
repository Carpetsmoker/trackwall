DNS proxy and filter.

It's intended usage is to block third-party browser requests. It's not intended
to "block advertisement" as such, rather it's intended to "block third party
requests".

It's inspired by adsuck, which unfortunately hasn't been updated in a few years
and is suffering from some problems.

Advantages:

- Lightweight.
- Browser independent − also works for requests outside the browser.
- Will not endlessly frob in web page's DOM (which many adblocks do).

To be fair, there are some disadvantages as well:

- It's currently a bit more difficult to set up.
- Unable to filter by URL (only domain name). This is usually not a problem
  unless you want to filter out every last advertisement (which is not this
  program's goal).

Getting started
===============

Download and building
---------------------
dnsblock is written in Go, so you'll need that. Tested systems are:

- Go 1.5 on OpenBSD 5.9
- Go 1.6 on VoidLinux (musl libc)
- Go 1.6 on Ubuntu 16.04
- Go 1.6 on Arch Linux

Other POSIX systems should also work.

You can download and build it with:

	$ hg clone http://code.arp242.net/dnsblock
	$ cd dnsblock
	$ ./build.sh
	$ ./install.sh

Setting up `/etc/resolv.conf`
-----------------------------
After dnsblock is up and running you'll need to tell the OS to actually use it.
This is usually done by adding `nameserver <addr>` to `/etc/resolv.conf`. Most
systems auto-generate this file (usually from DHCP).

### OpenBSD
Set `/etc/dhclient.conf` to something like:

	# The installer adds this line, not strictly needed
	send host-name "yourhostname";

	# List our nameserver first
	prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.53;

Running `sh /etc/netstart` will apply the settings.

If you want to listen on the loopback interface that is not `127.0.0.1` (which
is the case by default) you'll have to add that address as an alias, which can
be done in `/etc/hostname.lo0`:

	inet alias 127.0.0.53

Running `sh /etc/netstart` will apply the settings.

### VoidLinux
If you're using the GNU libc version then setting `/etc/resolv.conf.head` to:

    nameserver 127.0.0.53

should be enough.

**Note**: if you're using the musl libc version then this won't work as
expected, since musl's resolvers sends a query to *all* nameservers and uses
whichever one responds fastest, so you'll need to set *only* dnsblock as the
nameserver. This can be done by creating
`/usr/libexec/dhcpcd-hooks/90-resolv.conf` with:

	#!/bin/sh
	echo 'nameserver 127.0.0.53' > /etc/resolv.conf

Don't forget to make this executable! You'll also need to set the `dns-forward`
setting manually in `/etc/dnsblock/config`.

### Ubuntu
Set `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head` to:

	nameserver 127.0.0.53

and run `resolvconf -u`.

### Arch Linux
Add to `/etc/resolvconf.conf` to :

	name_servers=127.0.0.53

and run `resolvconf -u`.


Browser setup
--------------

### Root certificate
On first startup a root certificate will be generated and put in
`/var/dnsblock`. We use this root certificate to sign https requests.

You will need to import this certificate in your browser.


**NOTE!** Make sure the certificate is readable! Firefox will **NOT** show an
error or warning if it's not.

### Cache
You will need to turn off the hyper-aggressive ttl-ignoring DNS cache that both
Firefox and Chrome are infected with.

How it works
============
An address like:

	http://blocked.example.com/some_script.js

will be resolved to:

	http://127.0.0.53:80/some_script.js

dnsblock runs a HTTP server at `127.0.0.53:80` and `127.0.0.53:443` which will
either:

1. Serve some no-ops for some common scripts so web pages don't error out
   (Google Analytics, AddThis, etc.).
2. Serve an simple HTML or JS page informing the user that this request is
   blocked. This is a useful so that you don't have to guess *why* a request
   doesn't work and to keep the browser's error log clutter-free.

ChangeLog
=========
No release yet. This is experimental software.

TODO
====
- Figure out a better name (there is already a project named dnsblock!)
- Listen to signals to reload
- Measure some degree of performance

FAQ
===

Will this serve as a local DNS resolver and/or cache?
-----------------------------------------------------
No. This is not a DNS resolver/cache, just a proxy/filter. If you're looking for
a DNS cache then [unbound][unbound] is a good option. Running both on even an
older system should be fine (the dnsblock author is running them both on a
ten-year old OpenBSD laptop).

This program sucks. What alternatives are there?
